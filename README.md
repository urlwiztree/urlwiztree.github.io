# WizTree 


Find the files and folders using the most space on your hard drive - QUICKLY!


## What is WizTree?

A extremely quick disk space analyzer for Windows is called WizTree. You can see which files and folders are consuming the most disk space once it examines your hard drive. Visual representation of the complete file system on your hard disk makes it very simple to find big files and directories. Utilize WizTree's data to easily identify and get rid of "space hogs" from your hard drive.

## What makes WizTree so fast?

WizTree reads the Master File Table (MFT) of the hard drive directly from the disk when scanning NTFS-formatted hard drives (the majority of contemporary hard drives utilize this format). The NTFS file system uses the MFT, a unique hidden file, to keep track of all the files and directories on a hard drive. This method of searching for files fully avoids the operating system (Windows) and offers a significant efficiency improvement.

## How to Use WizTree?

A fast check of your hard drive using the automatic disk space analyzer WizTree will reveal which files or folders are utilizing the highest proportion of available disk space. 

**Using Wiztree is a bludge. Once you have installed and opened WizTree:**

* You can choose which disk to scan by clicking the button in the upper left corner of your screen. Here, pick a disk.
To allow WizTree finish the scan, click the Scan button and wait a short while.

* Wiztree will display statistical information (such size and item count) about all of the folders on that drive after the scan is finished. Expanding folders reveals subfolders and their further information.

* You can quickly see what is occupying the most space from these statistics. Once you know, you can select Explore Folder from the context menu when you right-click on the folder name to access the appropriate folder. Any unwanted huge files using up space on your Windows can be easily deleted from here.
