# WizTree 


Find the files and folders using the most space on your hard drive - QUICKLY!


## What is WizTree?

A extremely quick disk space analyzer for Windows is called WizTree. You can see which files and folders are consuming the most disk space once it examines your hard drive. Visual representation of the complete file system on your hard disk makes it very simple to find big files and directories. Utilize WizTree's data to easily identify and get rid of "space hogs" from your hard drive.

## What makes WizTree so fast?

WizTree reads the Master File Table (MFT) of the hard drive directly from the disk when scanning NTFS-formatted hard drives (the majority of contemporary hard drives utilize this format). The NTFS file system uses the MFT, a unique hidden file, to keep track of all the files and directories on a hard drive. This method of searching for files fully avoids the operating system (Windows) and offers a significant efficiency improvement.
